# Pragmatic-Git

A starter guide for frontend developers to swiftly begin their journey with Git.

## Why this Guide ?
Throughout my professional journey, I've observed several instances where UI and Frontend developers have faced challenges while utilizing Git with GitHub. 

In response, I've developed a structured guide with specific viewpoints to aid them in effectively navigating Git, this guide doen't promise to be comprihensive but will give you most within next 15mins

# Outline:

## 01: Intro to Version Control & Git
- What is version control?
    - Version control: System for managing and tracking changes to files.
    - Keeps a historical record of changes made over time.
    - Enables collaboration among team members.
    - Provides a way to revert to previous versions if needed.
    - Helps in identifying who made what changes and when.
    - Reduces the risk of data loss and conflicts in projects.
    - Commonly used in software development to manage code changes.
- Why we need version control in frontend projects, when?
    - **Working Solo:**
        - Keeps track of changes made during development.
        - Enables experimentation without fear of losing progress.
        - Provides a safety net to revert to previous versions if       issues arise.
        - Helps in maintaining a clean and organized codebase.
        - Facilitates code review for self-improvement.

    - **Working in Teams:**
        - Facilitates collaboration among team members.
        - Allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase       simultaneously.
        - Helps manage conflicts when multiple people modify the same       file.
        - Provides a central repository for code, reducing      duplication.
        - Enhances communication by providing a clear history of        changes.
        - Enables easy integration of new features and bug fixes.
        - Setup recommendation
        - Choosing a Git client: Should you choose Graphical interfaces or command-line.

- Setup recommendation: Install Git on your local machine.
- Choosing a Git client:
  - Graphical interfaces: User-friendly, visual representation.
  - Command-line: More control, efficient for advanced users.


## 02: Git Basics for Frontend Developers

- `git init`
- `git clone` 
- `git status`
- `git add`, 
- `git commit`
    -  writing meaningful commit messages.
- `.gitignore`


## 03: Branching Strategies

- Understanding Branches: 
    - `master/main`
    - `feature branches` 
    - `release branches` 
    - `hotfix branches`
- Openiated Branch Nomenclature    
- `git branch` 
- `git checkout`
- `git merge` 
    -  `Wear Reviewer Hat`: why raise PR when even when you are only one wokring on code?


## 04: Collaborative Development (working in team)
- `git fetch`
- `git pull`
- `git push`
- Pull requests / merge requests:
