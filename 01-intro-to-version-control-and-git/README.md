# 01: Intro to Version Control & Git

## What is version control?
Version control is a system that tracks and manages changes to files and projects over time. 
- It enables collaboration, keeps a history of edits, 
- Allows you to revert to previous states. 
- Helps in maintaining code integrity, collaborating effectively, and managing software development efficiently.

## Version Control in Frontend Projects: Why and When?
### Working Solo:
Version control is crucial even when working solo on frontend projects. It offers benefits such as:

- **History Tracking:** Keep a record of changes, allowing you to review and revert to previous versions if needed.
  
- **Experimentation:** Try out new ideas without fear of losing functional code, as you can always return to a stable state.
  
- **Mistake Recovery:** Quickly recover from errors or unintended changes by reverting to a known working state.
  
### Working in Teams:
Version control becomes even more critical when collaborating on frontend projects as a team:

- **Collaboration:** Different team members can work on different parts simultaneously, and version control ensures their changes are integrated smoothly.
  
- **Conflict Management:** Handle conflicts that arise when multiple team members modify the same files, ensuring smooth code merging.
  
- **Code Review:** Facilitate code review by providing an organized way to view and discuss changes before integration.
  
- **Accountability:** Know who made what changes, aiding in debugging and accountability.
  
In both scenarios, version control enhances efficiency, collaboration, and the overall quality of frontend development projects.

## Choosing a Git client: 
### Should you choose Graphical interfaces or command-line?
<br/>

#### Graphical Interfaces client:
It refers to using software that offers an interactive interface for performing Git-related tasks.
- User-friendly visuals.
- Suitable for beginners.
- Limited flexibility for complex tasks.
- Platform-specific limitations.

Command-Line client: 
It refers to using terminal to execute commands for performing Git-related tasks.
- Full control over Git commands.
- Essential for scripting.
- Efficient for common tasks.
- Learning curve and potential typing errors.

### My Recommendation: Use Command-line tool, 
Using a command-line tool might initially feel overwhelming, but it typically becomes much more manageable within the first week of practice.
